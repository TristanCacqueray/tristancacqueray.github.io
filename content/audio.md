On this page you can access the music I produced.
These are original recordings, made in my home studio,
with the following synthesizers and mixers:

- 2012 **Prelude**: RS7000, Access Virus B.
- 2013 **Andromeda**: Yamaha N12, Andromeda A6, MicroWave XT.
- 2014 **Raison**: Propellerhead Reason.
- 2015 **YUL**: Reason and midi keyboard.
- 2022 **opFreak**: Reaper, OP1, DrumBrute and Î¼Freak.

Here are the things I would like to add to this page:

- Download button.
- Playlist menu, for best of, elevator music, nrj, ...
- Individual page per album and song with production notes. This will also provides a RSS feed thanks to emanote.
- Timestamp markers to jump to a specific part.
- Cover image and notes of the playing track displayed on this page.
- Import missing files.

Of course I would like to fix the player, I love WinAmp,
but this web implementation is janky. A lighter player,
with waveform display, might be used in the future.

Lastly I would like to share the raw stems and the Reaper projects.
