# opFreak - opCapacity

For this compo I plugged the OP-1 directly into Reaper using a miniFuse audio interface.
This was recorded in one-shot, and I kept most of it for a live home studio feel.

Here are the different tracks:

- Lula: made with the digital patch named *Lullaby Time* with a delay size modulated by free lfo.
- Keys: made with the voltage patch named *Celestial-464* from the LOFI Hip Hop pack, using the arpegio sequencer.
- Bass: made with the digital patch named *FEUX DOUX 530* in legato playmode.
- Drum: made with the [J Dilla kit][jdilla], using the drum pattern from Flim (AFX) as transcribed by captain pikant. The snare and hats sometime goes through the COW effect.
- Bell: made with the dsynth patch named *Haunted*, as usual.
