title: Emacs

Emacs is among the oldest #[[free-software]] still under development.
It is programmable with [[emacs-lisp]]#.

My Emacs is powered by [[devenv]] and customized in my [dot-files/init.el](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray/dot-files/blob/master/home/.config/emacs/init.el).

Here are the posts I wrote about it:

```query
