Over the past month, I have written a comprehensive [[tutorial|Emacs Tutorial]] to help users
get started with this powerful environment.
Two of my teammates were able to adopt Emacs as their daily driver within just a few days of practice,
transitioning from VSCode and Vim.

I initially planned to cover all the available features and record a screencast to demonstrate
the Emacs experience from the ground up. However, since the current version is already useful,
I am happy to release it as-is. Please let me know if you would be interested in a second part.
